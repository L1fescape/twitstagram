# Twitstagram

Twitstagram is a chrome extension that adds Instagram photos inside of your Twitter feed on [twitter.com](ttps://twitter.com). It has the same behavior as a picture through Twitter (pic.twitter.com) on your feed in that it's visible only when the tweet is expanded. Works on all profile pages as well.
